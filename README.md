# ERP CORE
The [ERP CORE](https://erpinfo.org/erp-core) is a freely available online resource consisting of optimized paradigms, experiment control scripts, example data from 40 participants, data processing pipelines and analysis scripts, and a broad set of results for 7 different ERP components obtained from 6 different ERP paradigms:

* N170 (Face Perception Paradigm)

* MMN (Passive Auditory Oddball Paradigm)

* N2pc (Simple Visual Search Paradigm)

* N400 (Word Pair Judgement Paradigm)

* P3b (Active Visual Oddball Paradigm)

* LRP and ERN (Flankers Paradigm)

The experiment control scripts, data, and data analysis scripts are downloadable from the links below. 

A preprint of a journal article describing the [ERP CORE is available here](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/4azqm).

### Experiment Control Scripts and Installation Instructions
The experiment control scripts were written in [NeuroBehavioral Systems Presentation](https://www.neurobs.com/menu_presentation/menu_features/features_overview). See the 'other/Experimental Control Files' for details. You must download Presentation to open the .PAK files and run these scripts. You can download a [free trial version of the Presentation software](https://www.neurobs.com/menu_presentation/menu_features/features_overview) to access the scripts. Some of the stimuli are generated within the Presentation scripts, and some are visible within the OpenNeuro task descriptions.

### Data and Analysis Scripts
Analysis scripts can be found on GitHub, at: https://github.com/lucklab/ERP_CORE or in [this zip file](https://github.com/lucklab/ERP_CORE/archive/master.zip).

We also host these datasets on the OSF.io and OpenNeuro.
